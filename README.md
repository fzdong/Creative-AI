# Creative AI Project

**Creative AI** is about using artificial intelligence to automatically generate lyrics and music using datasets of your choice.

This program is designed to generate new music based off of the patterns of an existing music style. To use the program you must install the python library matplotlib and then you can run the program using a python interpreter(1). It is suggested that headphones are worn to better hear the generated music.

Program options:

(1) Option 1 will generate new music lyrics based off of the lyric style of The Beatles.

(2) Option 2 will generate a new song based off of the musical style of GameCube music. The song will be saved to a .wav which can be listend to using your computer's audio player.

(3) Option 3 will create a graph of the number of times 15 artists use a word.

(4) Option 4 will exit the program

Reach:

Data Visualization: If you select the 3 option in the menu the user can input a word. After the user inputs their word a graph is created to show the number of times a selection of 15 artists use that word within their song lyrics. There is a key for the graph in the command line portion of the program to connect the numbers on the X-axis to the artists.

Musical Harmony: Option 2 will make original music based off of the patterns found in Gamecube music. The generated music will consist of 3 layers: a main layer of a number of unique seperate verses, a randomly generated repeating backbeat using the lowest three notes in the same key as main, and a progression that scales the note series of the opposite key of main (if main is in a major key, then the progression will scale the respective minor), up and then down. The main layer is also designed to be slightly louder than the background layers.


Note: 
(1) *The interpreter should be compatible with Tkinter or another GUI output in order to display the data visualization graph. This is true for most interpetting enviroments and should not be a concern.*
